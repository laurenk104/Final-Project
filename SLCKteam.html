Our team, SLCK, was created through the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program where we were taught how to code. Members Sara, Lauren, Cindy and Karis (SLCK) make up the team. For our final project, we decided to develop a website that gives information we find useful about home remedies.  This project was great practice to test our problem solving skills and basic coding knowledge.
<br>
<br>
The word "ambrosia" is from Ancient Greek Mythology, and is often depicted as the food of the Greek gods. According to the myths, it can purify oneself and grant longevity. This is similar to the goals of the remedies we list on the website.

I am an incoming senior in high school, and this past summer of 2017, I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. As a part of Girls Who Code, I have been exposed to the tech world and have found a passion that I would not have discovered without GWC.
 I am part of a large family of seven, with three younger siblings. Because of my family background, I know that a daily struggle can be finding ways to use natural ingredients to cure an array of physical ailments. The goal of this website is to provide a resource for home remedies for all types of people.

	As an upcoming senior and a middle child of three in the Bay Area, there are so many opportunities for me to learn coding despite the fact that I have had almost no coding experience in the past. Although I am very shy and quiet by nature, I aspire to change and improve myself so that I can someday be brave enough to reach out to others and make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives. During my summer into senior year of high school, I am spending seven weeks in Girls Who Code to explore the immense and growing world of computer science. In this program, I have learned a lot about building confidence and character. In the future, I hope to implement some of my knowledge about coding into my interest in the medical field so that I can help improve diagnosis and treatments for illnesses or cancer.

	I am an upcoming junior who has greatly enjoyed this past summer at Girls Who Code. During this program, I was able to learn more about tech fields and my passion towards them. In addition to learning how to code, I had the opportunity to meet many new friends who I would not have known otherwise.

I am a senior in high school who has spent my summer at Girls Who Code.  In Girls Who Code, I have been exposed to multiple coding platforms such as Python, JavaScript and HTML.  With this project, I was able to practice my skills coding and have fun researching about home remedies.
